# Obesity Level Predictor 🍔💪

Welcome to the Obesity Level Predictor project! This project aims to predict obesity levels based on various factors like age, height, weight, lifestyle habits, and more. It's not just about predicting; it's about empowering users to make healthier choices and lead better lives.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly Express
- Streamlit

## Overview ℹ️

The project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict obesity levels using a dataset containing information about individuals' demographics, lifestyle choices, and health status. The dataset is preprocessed using techniques like encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.

Developing this project was an enjoyable journey! From exploring the dataset to fine-tuning machine learning models, every step brought new insights and challenges. I particularly enjoyed leveraging Plotly Express for interactive data visualization and Streamlit for building an intuitive web application.

## New Addition: Streamlit App 🚀

A significant addition to the project is the integration of a Streamlit web application. The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to input their data and receive predictions on their obesity levels. It enhances user experience and makes the project more accessible to a wider audience.
